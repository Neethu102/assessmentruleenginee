Steps to Run the Application

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
You can download it from Node.js.
npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. Ensure it's installed and up to date:
npm install -g npm@latest

2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. In your terminal, run:
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your React project repository.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, move into the project folder:
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the actual name of the folder.

4. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary project dependencies by running:
npm install
This will download all the required packages specified in the package.json file.

5. Start the Application

To start the development server and run the application locally, execute the following command:
npm start
This will start a local server, and you should see the application running on http://localhost:3000.

6. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000
The application should now be running in development mode.

7. Building for Production

If you need to create an optimized build for deployment, you can run:
